# Introduction

## About Razer Chroma
Razer is a company based in San Diego, California that has the mission to create the best products for the gaming industry. One of the most prestigious products from Razer are their peripherals. Ranging from  headphones, keyboards and mice, they have a huge product base which many believe are the top of the line of its category. One of its most reputable line of products is their Razer ChromaTM brand which consists of peripherals with fully customizable RGB LED lighting. Razer has various methods of customizing your deviceâ€™s lights including a GUI profile creator and an SDK to integrate the Chroma features with your own software.

## Why should I ChromeIt!?
Razer Chroma SDK is developed for C/C++/C# which for some programmers and people with limited programming knowledge can be extremely tedious. The goal of creating a programming language like ChromIt is making the ChromaTM integration very easy for individuals who are not familiar with the previously mentioned languages. With easy syntax you can still create profiles using code rather than the GUI, without the need to struggle learning a complex language like C/C++/C#.
